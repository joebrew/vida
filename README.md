VIDA VA data standardization

## Objective

The objective of this project is to take verbal autopsy data from 3 different countries with multiple data formats and to standardize to the 2016 WHO VA format.

## Data sources

There are 3 data sources

### Mali

From GEMS to the present, Mali has used only the 2007 WHO VA form.  This form has not been entered into any database.  Mali plans to transition to the 2016 WHO VA form before the summer, at which point data will be captured in the OpenHDS system.  Some of Mali’s VA data was coded by physicians as part of GEMS, but it will have to be entered into a database to undergo automated coding.  Because no data dictionary exists yet, I haven’t included any documents for Mali.
 
### The Gambia  
 
The Gambia site has used three forms:

1. 2008 – 2013: INDEPTH Network VA form (a custom non-WHO form)
2. 2013 – 2017: 2012 WHO VA form
3. Feb 2017: 2016 WHO form 
 
They currently have a backlog of verbal autopsies (including deaths that happened >1 year ago) that they plan to conduct with the 2016 WHO instrument.  In the attached folder you will find the instruments and data dictionaries for the first two forms they used.  The data dictionary for the 2016 form has not been developed yet.
 
### Kenya 
 
The Kenya site has used four forms:
 
1. 2002 – 2007: customized INDEPTH form.  
2. 2007 – 2009: WHO SAVVY form
3. 2009 – 2013: 2007 WHO 
4. 2013 to now, Kenya has used the 2012 WHO form.
